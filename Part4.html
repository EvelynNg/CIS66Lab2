        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            I am a family person so my hobbies resolve around them.  We like to go to the park, listen to music, dance around and be silly.
            Maybe when my kids are all older, we can try <abbr title="Dance Dance Revolution"></abbr>DDR, I went thru a DDR phase in my younger years.

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>
            <dfn>family:</dfn> a group of people affiliated by birth or marriage.<br />
            We have three kids: <b><i>Kenneth</i></b>, <b><i>Jason</i></b>, and <b><i>Helen</i></b>, she is an January 1<sup>st</sup> baby. <br />
            So Happy New Year will always be extra happy for our family.     
        </p>
        <h2>Extras</h2>
        <p>
            My <em>little</em> family is small.  However what I consider family is my extended family, which is <strong><ins>huge</ins></strong>.  The kids always have a blast when we get together.

            My favorite quote is:
            <blockquote>You wouldn't worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do</blockquote>
            I live my life freely because I feel this quote is so true. In addition, the people that do think about you, are your family and friends.  So naturally those are always good thoughts.
